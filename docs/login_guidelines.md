# Login Troubleshooting Guidelines

If you run into issues signing in, try the following steps:

1. **Clear your browser cookies** to remove stale sessions.
2. **Use the email/password form** if you have registered an account. Make sure the credentials are correct.
3. **For Google or Apple sign-in**, ensure browser pop-ups are allowed. After the provider window completes you should be redirected to your profile page.
4. If sign-in fails, look for the error message displayed on the form. Most issues relate to invalid credentials or provider permissions.
5. If problems persist, check your network connection and ensure your Firebase project credentials are correct.

These steps help avoid the most common authentication problems.
